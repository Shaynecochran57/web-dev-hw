# Project 1 Report

- Opera and Safari are my main web browsers. Web browsers are different types os software programs that allow us to access information and view different things online.

- Browsers were much less complex in the 90's and it wasn't until 1993 when NCSA Mosaic was credited as the first browser to display images embedded within the text.

- This week was fun because we got to play around with html and learned how to build a live site and publish it to GitHub.
