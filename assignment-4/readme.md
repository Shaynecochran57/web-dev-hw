  -Ids must be a unique identifier to a specific element.
  -The span element is used to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling.

 3. This week we became more familiar with html files and adding different structures to the files such as images, video's, and audio using Iframes. I felt much more comfortable this week and found myself working through issues that arose much quicker.
