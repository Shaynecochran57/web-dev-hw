# Assignment 3 Technical Report

- A page can only one main head and body element to it. Head elements tell the browser and processor information about the HTML document, such as the title, author, and publication date. The head also has elements such as the meta, viewport, and links. The body of the page is where all of the "meat and potatoes" goes.

- The structural markup holds information about the structure of the website. This would include information such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. The semantic markup has more do with the way we see certain word of phrases on the structure. This would include elements such as bold or italicized words.

- This week we focused more on html and became more familiar with building a live site. I found myself struggling a lot again, but always found a way to work through my problems and figure out where I went wrong.
