# Assignment 2
A Version Control System allows a developer or writer to make c hanges to a file and track their changes over time. By making changes to a file, the developer can create a list of how they have changed the file over time allowing them to stay on track of what they have done and what else they need to do. Version control makes collaboration and sharing easier which I believe could be very useful in our class because it could help keep us all engaged with each others work.

This week was very difficult for me and without office hours I don't think I ever would have finished this assignment. I found it very difficult to manage GitHub and trying to figure out how to get my data on the Atom app and then push it to GitHub. I found it very interesting learning about repositories and the different ways data travels around the world on the internet.
